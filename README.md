Project Title: Recipe Finder Application
Team Members: Md Muid Hasan Anik, Nathan Sutcliffe, Nadia Bourial
Brief Description with User Story:
User Story List:
As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes using ingredients I have on hand.
As a user, I want to see a list of recipes and their ingredients when I input ingredients.
As a user, I want to be able to view recipes fetched from two different API's, such as Spoonacular and Edamam.
As a user, I want to be able to save my search history and saved recipes in local storage.
As a user, I want to have an easy to use UI that is built with Bootstrap and responsive.
As a user, I want the app to be deployed on GitHub Pages, following coding standards and best practices.
As a user, I want to have a README that includes a description of the project, technologies used, screenshots, and a link to the deployed application.

Audience for this project : Home cooks who are looking for recipes to make using ingredients they have on hand. They should be looking for a quick and easy way to search for recipes and save the results to their device for future reference.

problem the product will address : The problem that this product will address is the difficulty of finding recipes using only the ingredients a user has on hand. By providing a search function that pulls from two different API's, users can easily find recipes for whatever ingredients they have available. The app also saves the search history and saved recipes to local storage, making it easier for users to access their preferences quickly and reliably.

Solution of the problem: The product solves the problem of not knowing what to cook for dinner by allowing users to quickly search for recipes using ingredients they have on hand. Users can input their ingredients and the app will pull recipes from two different API's, Spoonacular and Edamam, to display a list of recipes that they can make. The app also saves the user's search history and saved recipes to local storage, so they are persistent between page refreshes. The app also utilizes Bootstrap to make the UI responsive and it is deployed on GitHub Pages, following coding standards and best practices. Lastly, the README includes a description of the project, the technologies used, screenshots, and a link to the deployed application.
